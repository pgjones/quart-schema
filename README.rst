Quart-Schema
============

|Build Status| |docs| |pypi| |python| |license|

Quart-Schema is a Quart extension that provides schema validation and
auto-generated API documentation. This is particularly useful when
writing RESTful APIs.

Quickstart
----------

Quart-Schema can validate an existing Quart route by decorating it
with ``validate_querystring``, ``validate_request``, or
``validate_response``. It can also validate the JSON data sent and
received over websockets using the ``send_as`` and ``receive_as``
methods.

.. code-block:: python

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from datetime import datetime
    from typing import Optional

    from quart import Quart, websocket
    from quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response

    app = Quart(__name__)
    QuartSchema(app)

    @dataclass
    class Todo:
        task: str
        due: Optional[datetime] = None

    @app.post("/")
    @validate_request(Todo)
    @validate_response(Todo, 201)
    async def create_todo(data: Todo) -> tuple[Todo, int]:
        ... # Do something with data, e.g. save to the DB
        return data, 201

    @app.websocket("/ws")
    async def ws() -> None:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_as(Todo)
            ... # Do something with data, e.g. save to the DB
            await websocket.send_as(data, Todo)

The documentation is served by default at ``/openapi.json`` according
to the OpenAPI standard, or at ``/docs`` for a `SwaggerUI
<https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/>`_ interface, or ``/redocs`` for
a `redoc <https://github.com/Redocly/redoc>`_ interface. Note that
there is currently no documentation standard for WebSockets.
